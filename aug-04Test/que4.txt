what is the use of useMemo?

ans.   
useMemo is a buid in hook of react that allows us to memorize some functions so that we can avoid calling them on 
every render. we simply pass in a function and an array of inputs and useMemo will only recompute the memoized value
 when one of the inputs has changed.
